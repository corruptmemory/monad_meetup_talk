# Whirlwind intro to Haskell and Monads

This material was developed for a functional language meetup.  The intended audience is supposed to have programming experience for sure, and at least some exposure with a "functional" language: Lisp/Scheme/Clojure/Racket, Scala, SML, etc.  The presentation tries to work through some of the more specific features of Haskell needed to talk about Monads.
